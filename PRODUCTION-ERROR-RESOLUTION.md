# Production Error Resolution Summary

## Original Error
The Azure Function was failing with critical parsing errors during module loading:

```
EXCEPTION: CRITICAL ERROR processing alert fa60edd8-1a00-4328-8467-ac0a65ca9c3a after 1.7596596 seconds
Exception: Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WriteErrorException
```

Specific parsing errors included:
- `Unexpected token '"'` on line 1047
- `Unexpected token '‹"` on line 1084  
- `Unexpected token '¾"` on line 1074

## Root Cause
The `TicketHandler.psm1` module contained Unicode emoji characters that were being corrupted during Azure Function execution, causing PowerShell parsing failures. The corrupted characters were:

1. `🔒` (lock emoji) → `ðŸ"'` (corrupted)
2. `🧠` (brain emoji) → `ðŸ§ ` (corrupted)
3. `💾` (disk emoji) → `ðŸ'¾` (corrupted)
4. `📋` (clipboard emoji) → `ðŸ"‹` (corrupted)
5. `🚨` (siren emoji) → `ðŸš¨` (corrupted)
6. `⚠️` (warning emoji) → parsing issues

## Resolution Applied

### 1. Emoji Character Replacement
All problematic emoji characters were replaced with text alternatives:
- `🔒` → `[LOCK]`
- `🧠` → `[MEM]`  
- `💾` → `[DISK]`
- `📋` → `[LOG]`
- `🚨` → `[ALERT]`
- `⚠️` → `[WARN]`

### 2. Regex Pattern Fix
Fixed regex pattern escaping in two functions:
- Changed `(.+)\((.+)\)` to `(.+)\\((.+)\\)` to properly escape parentheses

## Verification
- ✅ PowerShell parsing now succeeds without errors
- ✅ Module syntax validation passes
- ✅ No Unicode/encoding related parsing errors
- ✅ Functions are properly exported and available

## Impact on Production
This fix resolves the critical error that was preventing the Azure Function from processing alerts. The function should now:

1. Load modules successfully during cold start
2. Process memory usage alerts via `Test-MemoryUsageConsolidation`
3. Execute Teams webhook notifications
4. Handle all alert types without parsing failures

## Additional Benefits
- Teams notifications will still display meaningful icons (`[MEM]`, `[DISK]`, etc.)
- No functionality is lost, only visual presentation is simplified
- Eliminates encoding dependency on Azure Function runtime
- Reduces risk of similar Unicode-related issues in the future

## Recommendation
Deploy this fix immediately to production to restore alert processing functionality.
